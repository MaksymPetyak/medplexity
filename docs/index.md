We see medplexity most useful for the following groups: 

* Builders in the medical space who want to experiment with different architectures.
* Researchers who want to evaluate their new LLMs on existing benchmarks.
* Medical professionals who want to understand the capabilities of LLMs and their limitations.
* Anyone curious about LLMs in healthcare :)
