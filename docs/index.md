Medplexity is a python library to help with evaluation of LLMs for medical applications.

It provides easy interfaces to use existing benchmarks, including MedQA, PubMedQA, etc. and evaluate performance of LLMs and more complex chains on these benchmarks.

### Who should use Medplexity?

We see medplexity most useful for the following groups: 

* Builders in the medical space who want to experiment with different architectures.
* Researchers who want to evaluate their new LLMs on existing benchmarks.
* Medical professionals who want to understand the capabilities of LLMs and their limitations.
* Anyone curious about LLMs in healthcare :)
