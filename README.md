Medplexity is a python library to help with evaluation of LLMs for medical applications.

<img src="images/medplexity-logo.png" alt="medplexity-logo" width="512px" style="border-radius: 16px;"/>

It is designed to help with the following tasks:
- Evaluating performance of LLMs on existing medical datasets and benchmarks. E.g. MedQA, PubMedQA, etc.
- Comparing performance of different prompts, models, and architectures.
- Exporting results of evaluation for visualisation and further analysis. 

The goal is to help answer questions like "How much better would GPT-4 perform given a vector database to load certain resources?".


## ðŸ”§ Quick install
